On the `configuration.json` file, you should put the latitude and longitude of the place where the forecast will be
queried. For example, if you live in [Bat Cave, NC, USA](https://goo.gl/maps/vw3Xkq5FYBw7zrbp9) the configuration would
look as follows:
```json
{
  "latitude": 35.4515,
  "longitude": -82.2871
}
```
