Calendar powered by [Google](https://developers.google.com/calendar)

On the `configuration.json` file, put the ids of the calendars that you wish to use.
If you are not sure which ids you have to use, put in an empty list of ids and run the module, it will raise an warning
which includes all available calendar ids and their human readable names.

For more information on how to get the credentials working, refer to
[google's API documentation](https://developers.google.com/calendar/overview)
